# String Method Practice: replaceAll()

## Objective
Practice using the `replaceAll()` method of the String class in Java to remove unwanted characters from a string.

## Instructions

1. **Create a String Variable**
   - Inside the `main` method, declare a `String` variable named `phoneNumber` and assign it the value:
     ```
     "(123) 456-7890"
     ```

2. **Remove Non-Digit Characters**
   - Use the `replaceAll()` method with the regular expression to remove all non-digit characters from the phone number.
   - You may store the result in the same variable or in a new variable.

3. **Print the Result**
   - Use `System.out.println` to print the cleaned phone number.

## Expected Output
```
1234567890
```

## Tips
- Remember that `replaceAll()` returns a new string, so ensure you print that new string.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure that you are printing the result of the `replaceAll()` operation.

Happy coding!
