# String Method : indexOf()

## Objective
Practice using the indexOf() method of the String class in Java to find indexes of characters.

## Instructions

**Analyzing a Word**

In this exercise, you will learn how to search in a character using indexOf().

For you to do:

1. Declare a String variable named `word` and assign it the value: "hello".

2. Use the indexOf() method to find the position of the first occurrence of the letter 'o' in the word and store it in an int variable.

3. Use the indexOf() method to try to find the letter 'j' in the word and store the result in an int variable.

4. Print the results in the format:
   - Position of first 'o': [index]
   - Position of 'j': [index]

## Example Output
```
Position of first 'o': 4
Position of 'j': -1
```


## Tips

- The indexOf() method returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified character.
- If the character is not found, indexOf() returns -1.
- Remember that string indices start at 0 in Java.

## Troubleshooting

- Make sure you're using the correct method name (indexOf).
- Check that you're using the correct character literals in your indexOf() calls.
- Remember that indexOf() is case-sensitive.
