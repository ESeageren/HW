# Reversing a String Using StringBuilder

**Objective:**  
Learn how to create a `StringBuilder` object from a string, use its `reverse()` method to reverse the characters, and then print the reversed result.

**Instructions:**

1. Create a `StringBuilder` object using value (for example, `"car"`).
2. Call the `reverse()` method on the `StringBuilder` to reverse the characters.
3. Print the reversed string.


**Expected Output:**
```
Reversed: rac
```

**Tips:**
- **Test with Different Strings:** Try using different words to see how the `reverse()` method works with each.
- **Method Chaining:** Explore how you could chain methods together, for example, `new StringBuilder(original).reverse().toString()` to get the reversed string in one line.

**Troubleshooting:**
- **Check Your StringBuilder Initialization:** Make sure that you pass the correct string value when creating your `StringBuilder` object.
- **Verify the Reverse Method:** Ensure that you actually call the `reverse()` method on your `StringBuilder` object before printing.
- **Confirm Output:** Double-check that both the original and reversed values are printed, so you can compare them easily.

Happy coding!
